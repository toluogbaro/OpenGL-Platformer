# Comp703-Submission
Visual Studio Solution for OpenGL work done on the Comp703 Module

Creative Commons Licence if you really want to. By Tolu Ogbaro

My name is Tolu Ogbaro and I'm a masters student on the Msc Programming Course

For the Comp703 module we're using digital games technology to recreate graphics and game engine components from scratch without using a game engine. 
My APIs of choice are OpenGL and SDL2.

For my project my main goal is a remake of Doodle Jump in 3D but pvp and with slimes. Very aspirational I know.

My four step program to achieve this:

-> Learning how to render using OpenGL

-> Softbody Physics for ball movement, faking a slime shader with fluid refraction and then adding basic SDL Input

-> Rendering platforms with different attributes using an entity component system; i.e platforms bending at different angles. Platforms with mesh renderers that
make them look ghost like (fall through platforms) and platforms affected by mass on each side that require the player to jump in the in the middle

-> Tying it all together with socket programming or with the SDL Networking Library

Until December 2023, Im just getting used to OpenGL and going through some basic tutorials

From December 2023, I will be attempting to do step 2

After step 2, Ill start with the network programming, just to set everything up prematurely and render on two screens with two different inputs

Then Ill do step 3

From January 2023, Ill focus more on the finishing touches until its submission time
For my stretch goals, I want to add SDL audio and make a couple custom game tunes with Bosca Ceoil if I have time
