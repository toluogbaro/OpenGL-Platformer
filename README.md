Visual Studio Solution for OpenGL work done on the Comp703 Module

Creative Commons Licence if you really want to. By Tolu Ogbaro

My name is Tolu Ogbaro and I'm a masters student on the Msc Programming Course

For the Comp703 module we're using digital games technology to recreate graphics and game engine components from scratch without using a game engine
My method of choice is OpenGL with Vertices

For my project my main goal is a remake of Doodle Jump in 3D but pvp and with slimes. Very aspirational I know.

My three step program to achieve this:

-> Softbody Physics and slime shader for the slime characters with Input

-> Rendering platforms with different attributes using an entity component system

-> Tying it all together with socket programming

and for my stretch goals, I want to add audio and make a couple custom game tunes with Bosca Ceoil if I have time

Until December 2023, Im just getting used to OpenGL and going through some basic tutorials

From December 2023, I will be attempting to do step 1

After step 1, Ill start with the network programming, just to tie everything together at the beginning. Rendering on two screens with two different inputs

Then Ill do step 2

From January, Ill focus more on the finishing touches until its submission time
