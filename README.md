# Comp703-Submission

Recreating Doodle Jump in 3D with nothing but Visual Studio and my hopes and dreams

My name is Tolu Ogbaro and I'm a masters student on the Msc Programming Course

Creative Commons Licence if you really want to

For the Comp703 module we're using digital games technology to recreate modern classics using low level graphics and game engine components from scratch 
without using a game engine. 

My APIs of choice are OpenGL and SDL2.

For this remake, the platforming will be horizontal with slime characters. Oh and its also PvP multiplayer because I'm a masochist.

To play around with the project in its current form, just download and unzip then open the visual studio solution and press [F5] to run the build

My four step program to achieve this:

1 -> Learning how to render using OpenGL

2 -> Softbody Physics for ball movement, faking a slime shader with fluid refraction and then adding basic SDL Input

3 -> Rendering platforms with different attributes using an entity component system; i.e platforms bending at different angles. Platforms with mesh renderers that
make them look ghost like (fall through platforms) and platforms affected by mass on each side that require the player to jump in the in the middle

4 -> Tying it all together with socket programming or with the SDL Networking Library

From mid November 2023 - Beginning of December 2023, Im just getting used to OpenGL and going through some basic tutorials

From December 2023, I will be attempting to do step 2

After step 2, Ill start with the network programming, just to set everything up prematurely and render on two screens with two different inputs

Then Ill do step 3

From January 2024, I'll focus more on the finishing touches until its submission time

For my stretch goals, I want to add SDL audio and make a couple custom game tunes with Bosca Ceoil if I have the time

Thanks for stopping by and witnessing my suffering
